Power Automate Cloud Flow to Populate an Excel Template file using Excel Scripts

This was first demo'd here https://damobird365.birdhoose.co.uk/2021/03/24/power-automate-office-scripts-populate-an-excel-template-dynamically-using-type-script 
with video demo on my YouTube Channel here https://youtu.be/lskqQNDegXc.

The proof of concept solution includes a copy of the two lists (Excel Files) required to build the data sources used in the MS Dev Demo named CustomerAccounts and WorkComplete
A copy of the Cloud Flow Solution that you can import into your own Power Automate environment for testing
A copy of both the original Excel Script written by me without prior Javascript/Typescript knowledge and the amended version 2, supplied to me by the Excel Dev Team

You must save the Excel Script file to your OneDrive MyFiles > Documents > Office Scripts or manually copy the file contents to a new Excel Script in Excel Online
